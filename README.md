# Python API Homework - What's the Weather Like?

## Background

Whether financial, political, or social -- data's true power 
ability to answer questions definitively. So let's take what 
about Python requests, APIs, and JSON traversals to answer a 
question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator

Now, we know what you may be thinking: _"Duh. It gets hotter.

But, if pressed, how would you **prove** it?

### Before You Begin

1. Create a new repository for this project called `python-ap
**Do not add this homework to an existing repository**.

2. Clone the new repository to your computer.

3. Inside your local git repository, create a directory for b
Python Challenges. Use folder names corresponding to the chal

4. Inside the folder that you just created, add new files cal
ipynb` and `VacationPy.ipynb`. These will be the main scripts
analysis.

5. Push the above changes to GitHub.

## Part I - WeatherPy

In this example, you'll be creating a Python script to visual
of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the 
accomplish this, you'll be utilizing a [simple Python library
python.org/pypi/citipy), the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://ope
api), and a little common sense to create a representative mo
across world cities.

Your first requirement is to create a series of scatter plots
following relationships:

* Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each plot add a sentence or too explaining what the cod

Your second requirement is to run linear regression on each r

degrees latitude) and Southern Hemisphere (less than 0 degree

* Northern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude

After each pair of plots explain what the linear regression i

Your final notebook must:

* Randomly select **at least** 500 unique (non-repeat) cities
latitude and longitude.
* Perform a weather check on each of the cities using a serie
API calls.
* Include a print log of each city as it's being processed wi
number and city name.
* Save a CSV of all retrieved data and a PNG image for each s

### Part II - VacationPy

Now let's use your skills in working with weather data to pla
vacations. Use jupyter-gmaps and the Google Places API for th
assignment.

* **Note:** Remember that any API usage beyond the $200 credi

* **Note:** if you having trouble displaying the maps try run
nbextension enable --py gmaps` in your environment and retry.

* Create a heat map that displays the humidity for every city
of the homework.

* Narrow down the DataFrame to find your ideal weather condit

  * A max temperature lower than 80 degrees but higher than 7

  * Wind speed less than 10 mph.

  * Zero cloudiness.

  * Drop any rows that don't contain all three conditions. Yo

* Plot the hotels on top of the humidity heatmap with each pi

As final considerations:

* Create a new GitHub repository for this project called `API
the kebab-case). **Do not add to an existing repo**
* You must complete your analysis using a Jupyter notebook.
* You must use the Matplotlib or Pandas plotting libraries.
* For Part I, you must include a written description of three
trends based on the data.
* For Part II, you must include a screenshot of the heatmap y
include it in your submission.
* You must use proper labeling of your plots, including aspec
Titles (with date of analysis) and Axes Labels.
* For max intensity in the heat map, try setting it to the hi
found in the data set.
